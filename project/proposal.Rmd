## 1. Introduction

  Airbnb, which puts together bed and breakfast listings from all over the world on an online platform, has been increasingly popular amongst tourists who prefer to stay in a local home at their destinations. The growth of Airbnb also sees homeowners taking the opportunity to create homely spaces, which are sometimes themed to fit various traveller preferences, giving them an alternative lodging experience that is unique from the monotonous hotel scene (Fig 1). The proliferation of Airbnbs around the world have also put a spolight on its negative effects on communities, neighbourhoods, housing market and the hotel industry.

  The Airbnb scene in Singapore is especially different because of the strict laws and regulations that surround short-term rentals in the city-state. Unlike other countries, the passing of these rental laws has steered the nation's Airbnb market away from conventional tourist groups. However, as of February 2020, there are 8047 Airbnb listings in Singapore (Inside Airbnb, 2020), which is surprising, considering the laws that surround rentals. These include both public and private housing. Therefore, this project aims to take on an exploratory approach to gaining insight about the Airbnb rentals in Singapore and why they still exist despite strict laws.
  

## 2. Literature Review

This section discusses literature regarding the effects that Airbnb rentals have had on cities, and the ways in which Singapore's policies have been shaped to curb the negative effects on short-term rentals like Airbnbs. 

### 2.1 Positive effects of Airbnbs for travellers
  According to Airbnb (2020a), the rise in listings has given millions the experience of living like a local, which 91% of travellers today want to do. This had led Airbnb listings to focus on neighbouhoods outside the usual tourist districts. This has also boosted the income of hosts, of whom 52% are from low to middle income families (Airbnb, 2020a). However, this also causes problems for cities.
  
### 2.2 Negative effects on neighbourhoods and society

A study conducted on Barcelona's old town revealed that 9.6% of homes were listed on Airbnb, and within its Gothic Quarter, this percentage was 16.8% (Cocola-Gant, 2016). Cocola-Gant (2016) argues that the prevelance of holiday rentals such as Airbnbs is one of the key reasons for urban gentrification and displacement of residents by tourists. 

In an attempt to upkeep mutli-racial integration and inclusivity in Singapore, the government has rolled out the HDB Ethnic Integration Policy, which provides an ethnic quota for public housing estates. While the efficacy of the quota is debatable, the impact on society and individual neighbourhoods could be a strong enough reason for the government to come up with these short-term rental laws, so as to upkeep a sense of identity amongst Singaporeans in these neighbourhoods.

### 2.3 Negative effects on traditional tourist lodging

Unsurprisingly, there has also been an effect on the hotel industry. The "Airbnb effect", threatens hotel revenues as a result of cheaper and sometimes, better-quality Airbnb listings (Gerdeman, 2015). Gerdeman (2015) revelead that this effect was particularly significant in cities where hotels had limited vacancies during peak periods, as the surge in Airbnb listings forced hotels to draw down their prices despite eventually being fully-booked.

### 2.4 Singapore's Laws on Short-term Rentals

While there are no laws against tourists staying in Airbnbs per se, the laws governing short-term rentals/accommodation restrict tourists from seeking Airbnbs as a potential accommodation when visiting Singapore. The Singapore government has imposed these laws to ensure safety and privacy, and minimise disturbances in residential areas, which may come about when residential areas are frequented by tourists (URA, 2020). 

Under the 2017 Planning Act, private housing have to be rented out for a minimum of three consecutive months (or 90 days) to the same person (SSO, 2020), while HDB flats require a minimum rental period of six months (180 days) under the Housing and Development Act. Additionally, flat owners must obtain approval from HDB for such rentals (HDB, 2020).

## 3. Research Question(s) & Hypotheses

  While Airbnb (2020a) claims to have  provided benefits to travellers and hosts around the world, discussions by various literature seem to focus on the  negative effects on neighbourhoods, housing market and especially the hotel industry (Coldwell, 2017; Xie & Kwok, 2017; Ioannides, RÃ¶slmaier & Van de Zee, 2018; Nieuwland & van Melik, 2018). This phenomenon, also known as the "Airbnb effect" has taken a toll on revenue for the hotel industry as a result of intense competition (Gerdeman, 2018). Perhaps, this is why Singapore has so many strict laws on short-term rentals.
  
  This leads us to the research question: Why are there still so many Airbnb listings in Singapore despite these strict laws?
  
In this context, here are the hypotheses of this study:
  
1. Many home owners may be flouting the rules.

2. The Airbnb market in Singapore targets Singaporeans, permanent residents, and long-term stayers with appropriate passes.

3. Most listings would be located in neighbourhoods where there are fewer HDB flats as it is more challenging for owners to meet the 180-day minimum stay. 
  
Some guiding questions include:
1. How risky is it for a tourist to stay in an Airbnb accommodation?
2. Which listings are likely violating the laws on short-term rentals in Singapore?
3. How much does it cost to rent a place from Airbnb in Singapore?
4. Where are most listings located at?
5. How does the availability vary with the type of listing?

## 4. Data Sources 

Data on the Airbnb rentals in Singapore is publicly available through the Inside Airbnb website at ```http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html```. Datasets are updated monthly, but for the sake of this project, I will be using data as of 27 February 2020.

There are three main components to the dataset:

* ```listings```: Provides detailed listings data for Singapore, including location, price, minimum length of stay, number of reviews, hosts and listing ID. 
* ```reviews```: Provides date and details of reviews and reviewer. 
* ```calendar```: Provides details of bookings across a year for each listing.

Additionally, I may use the following datasets to enhance my data analyses and visualisations:

* Planning area data from OneMap APIs
* Open data from HDB on data.gov.sg regarding rental demand, approvals and prices

The data is generally clean, but will require some degree of manipulation in the analysis process.

## 5. Research Approach

This study will take on a quantitative approach to finding out why Airbnbs still thrive in Singapore in spite of the strict laws. 

First, I aim to display the listings visually, in order to identify where most listings are located at, by planning area or neighbourhood. 

Second, I will analyse the number of reviews, and the minimum length of stay stipulated by hosts, which can be used as a proxy for hosts who are violating the short-term rental laws. This could also be used to assess the risk a tourist faces in choosing to book these Airbnb listings. 

Finally, I will find out the cost of renting Airbnbs, and the distribution across locations and time. Seasonal peaks in costs could correspond to peaks in tourism, and locations may relate to popular tourist destinations. The presence of these peaks may indicate a higher likelihood of hosts flouting the rules - though not certainly. Furthermore, prices would give us a sense of what the demand is like, and therefore address why Airbnbs continue to exist in Singapore.

## 6. Preliminary Data Analyses & Visualisation

```{r message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(httr)
library(mapedit)
library(mapview)
library(sf)
library(skimr)
library(lubridate)
library(forcats)
library(tmap)
```

```{r}
calendar_feb20 <- read_csv(here::here("projdata/calendar-feb20.csv"))
```


```{r}
listings <- read_csv(here::here("projdata/listings-feb20.csv"))

listings_sf <- st_as_sf(listings, coords = c("longitude", "latitude"), crs = 4326) %>%
  st_transform(3414)
# convert coordinates to be the same as those used on OneMap
```
### 6.1 No. of listings in the past year
```{r}
# values based on number of observations from previous months' listings
listings_time <- tribble(
  ~month, ~total_listings,
  "mar20", 7713,
  "feb20", 8047,
  "jan20", 7857,
  "dec19", 8000,
  "nov19", 7857,
  "oct19", 7794,
  "sep19", 7675,
  "aug19", 7907,
  "jul19", 8033,
  "jun19", 8293,
  "may19", 8325,
  "apr19", 8090,
  "mar19", 7975
)

month_order <- c(
  "mar19", "apr19", "may19", "jun19", "jul19", "aug19", "sep19", "oct19", "nov19",
  "dec19", "jan20", "feb20"
)

listings_time %>%
  mutate(month = ordered(month, levels = month_order)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = month, y = total_listings)) + geom_col(color = "grey", fill = "paleturquoise3") + geom_text(aes(label = total_listings), vjust = -0.5, size = 3) + labs(y = "Total listings")
```

While the number of listings looks quite stable over the past year, slight peaks can be observed during months that coincide with higher tourist volumes, such as May to June, and from December to February. Notably, listing numbers increased in February 2020 amidst the covid-19 situation, which is interesting considering the hotel industry has suffered a backlash due to reduced tourist traffic. Perhaps, these listings target long-term stayers more than tourists. 

Instead, if we look a tthe number of reviews over the years, it is apparent that the Airbnb scene has gained popularity over the years. 

### 6.2 Reviews over time
```{r}
reviews_feb20 <- read_csv(here::here("projdata/reviews-feb20.csv"))
```

```{r}
reviews_feb20 %>%
  ggplot() + geom_bar(aes(date)) + labs(y = "number of reviews") + theme_light()
```

The number of reviews seem to have increased over time.

```{r}
listings %>%
  group_by(neighbourhood) %>%
  count() %>%
  arrange(-(n)) %>% 
  head(10) %>% 
  kable()
```

### 6.3 Listings by region

```{r}
listings_sf %>%
  group_by(neighbourhood_group) %>%
  count()
```

```{r}
# Planning region .shp file was downloaded from https://geo.data.gov.sg/mp14-region-web-pl/2014/12/05/shp/mp14-region-web-pl.zip

pln_area_polyg <- read_sf(here::here("projdata/pln_boundary/MP14_REGION_WEB_PL.shp"))
```

```{r}
# visually
tmap_mode("view")
tm_shape(listings_sf) +
  tm_dots(col = "neighbourhood_group", size = 0.02) + tm_shape(pln_area_polyg) + tm_text("REGION_N")
```



### 6.4 Prices in Central Region
```{r fig.height = 4}
listings_sf %>%
  filter(neighbourhood != "Tuas") %>% 
  group_by(neighbourhood) %>%
  summarise(mean_price = mean(price)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = neighbourhood, y = mean_price)) + geom_col(color = "grey", fill = "paleturquoise3") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
```
Southern islands has the highest mean price for Airbnbs in the Central region, followed by Marina South and Orchard. 

### 6.5 Minimum number of nights

```{r}
below_90 <- listings_sf %>%
  select(id, host_name, neighbourhood, neighbourhood_group, minimum_nights, geometry) %>%
  filter(minimum_nights < 90)

below_90
```


A quick glance at the number of listings that are potentially violating the law (less than 90-day minimum stay), shown by coloured dots.
```{r}
tm_shape(listings_sf) + tm_dots(col = "black", size = 0.01) + tm_shape(below_90) + tm_dots(col = "neighbourhood_group", alpha = 0.4, size = 0.01)
```

### 6.6 Top host

The top host has 340 listings.
```{r}
listings %>% 
  group_by(host_id) %>% 
  select(host_id, host_name, calculated_host_listings_count) %>% 
  arrange(desc(calculated_host_listings_count))
```
