## 6.1 Introduction

In this session, we will start looking a the dimension reduction strategies. In general, theses strategies are used to turn a dataset with N dimensions into a dataset with N-x dimensions. 

Why is this important? A very practical concern is that in our data-rish urban environment of today, many of our datasets have many variables. How can we make sense of a dataset where we have dozens and dozens of variables for every single observation? 

As it turns out, in many cases, our variables have certain degrees of correlation: they share certain information (or variance in statistical terms) with, potentially, fewer dimensions or variables. 

We will see how this works in practice with two specific techniques:
1. Multidimensional scaling (MDS)
2. Principal Components Analysis (PCA)


## 6.2 MDS of MRT stations

The goal of MDS is relatively straightforward on a conceptual level: given a set of distances between objects, create a map (i.e. find the position of each object) that displays the relative position of each object correctly.

In mathematical terms, we are trying to minimise the stress between the real or observed distances (d) and the distances in the MDS map (d-hat).

Let's put this into practice by loading a dataset consisting of 10 MRT stations in Singapore and the distance (as the crow flies, in meters) between them. Note that the actual location of each station is NOT included in this dataset.

## tibble creation code created with datapasta: very useful for quickly copying small datasets to/from R.
```

Let's check what's in there:

```{r}
station_distance %>% head()
```

All our variables are of type ```chr```, so we will need to change some of them to numerical.
Additionally, the first column is the name of the MRT station. We want to use it as a "label" for the row, like we use column names as labels for columns: this is what ```column_to_rownames``` does. 

Once transformed, we can use the ```cmdscale``` function (available in base R) to perform our MDS process. We convert out tibble to matrix first, as that is the format that ```cmdscale``` is expecting.

 
```{r}
# convert to matrix ensuring distances are numeric
station_distance_matrix <- station_distance %>%
  column_to_rownames(var = "STN_NAME") %>%
  mutate_all(as.numeric) %>%
  as.matrix()
```

```{r}
# perform MDS
mds_station <- cmdscale(station_distance_matrix) %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  rename(Y1 = V1, Y2 = V2)
```

```{r}
# add station name to each position
mds_station <- station_distance %>%
  select(STN_NAME) %>%
  bind_cols(., mds_station)

mds_station
```

Those coordinates are difficult to read, so let's create a map:

```{r}
ggplot(mds_station, aes(x = Y1, y = -Y2)) +
  geom_text(aes(label = STN_NAME))

# the minus sign before Y2 is to correct the positions of the stations by flipping the data along the x-axis
```

If you know Singapore a little bit, you immediately recognize that the stations are more or less in the correct position! Not a bad result per se. But what if we didn’t exactly know the ‘real’ location of each station - how would we assess how well our MDS process has performed? One way would be to compare the real distances with the predicted distances. We can do this visually, as well as by calculating a stress metric.

```{r}
distance_pred <- cmdscale(station_distance_matrix) %>%
  dist(upper = T) %>%
  as.matrix()
distance <- station_distance_matrix

tibble(
  distance = as.vector(distance),
  distance_pred = as.vector(distance_pred)
) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = distance, y = distance_pred)) + geom_point()
```
They all fall in a line. E.g. if the distance is 10000, the reconstructed distance is also around 10000. Means it's pretty accurate.

```{r}
mds_stress <- function(d, d_hat) {
  sqrt(
    sum((d - d_hat)^2) / sum(d^2)
  )
}

mds_stress(distance, distance_pred)
```
The stress metric is very close to 0.


## 6.3 MDS with travel distance

The map we created in the previous section might seem quite trivial. Afterall, if we already know the exact position of each MRT station, why would we need to re-compute this position based on the distances between MRT stations? In fact, the real power of MDS comes from the fact that you can use ANY variable or indicator as the distance metric. 

For example, we can look at the distance travelled by the trains instead of geographical distance.

```{r}
station_mrt_distance <- tibble::tribble(
  ~STN_NAME, ~BENCOOLEN_MRT_STATION, ~DHOBY_GHAUT_MRT_STATION, ~JURONG_EAST_MRT_STATION, ~MARINA_BAY_MRT_STATION, ~PASIR_RIS_MRT_STATION, ~PUNGGOL_MRT_STATION, ~ROCHOR_MRT_STATION, ~TUAS_LINK_MRT_STATION, ~UPPER_CHANGI_MRT_STATION, ~YISHUN_MRT_STATION,

)

station_mrt_distance %>%
  head()
```


```{r}
# convert to matrix
stn_mrt_dist_matrix <- station_mrt_distance %>% 
  column_to_rownames(var="STN_NAME") %>% 
  as.matrix()

# perform MDS
mds_mrt <- cmdscale(stn_mrt_dist_matrix) %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  rename(Y1 = V1, Y2 = V2)

# add station name to each position
mds_mrt <- station_mrt_distance %>% 
  select(STN_NAME) %>% 
  bind_cols(., mds_mrt)

mds_mrt
```

```{r}
ggplot(mds_mrt, aes(x=-Y1, y=Y2)) + 
  geom_text(aes(label = STN_NAME))
```

```{r}
distance_pred_mrt <- cmdscale(stn_mrt_dist_matrix) %>% 
  dist(upper = T) %>% 
  as.matrix()

  distance_mrt <- stn_mrt_dist_matrix
  
tibble(
  distance_mrt = as.vector(distance_mrt), 
  distance_pred_mrt = as.vector(distance_pred_mrt)
) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = distance_mrt, y = distance_pred_mrt))+ geom_point()
```

```{r}
# calculate stress
mds_stress(distance_mrt, distance_pred_mrt)
```

Potential reason for the difference in metric with the previous section:
Geographical vs train travel distance can be very different considering they're all on different MRT lines. Therefore it might take a longer distance to travel from one point to another even though they are geographically super close. (E.g. bencoolen and dhoby ghaut)

```{r}
library(scales) # library for rescale function
mds_mrt <- mds_mrt %>% 
  mutate(y1_norm = rescale(Y1), 
         y2_norm = rescale(Y2))

mds_station <-  mds_station %>% 
  mutate(y1_norm = rescale(Y1),
         y2_norm = rescale(Y2))


ggplot(mds_station, aes(x = y1_norm, y = -y2_norm)) + 
  geom_label(aes(label = STN_NAME), color = "red", fill = rgb(1,1,1,0.5))+
  geom_label(data = mds_mrt, aes(x=-y1_norm, y = y2_norm, label = STN_NAME), color = "blue", fill = rgb(1,1,1,0.5))
```

## 6.4 MDS of Arbitrary Variables (2D)

In the previous section, you have explored the application of MDS to distances (both geographically and travel time) between MRT stations. While travel time distances might be interesting in and of itself, MDS can be applied to any type of distance. 

Furthermore, until now, we have only used two variables as input for our distance calculations so we can't really speak of dimension reduction as of yet!

In this section and next, we'll mitigate that by analysing a dataset of Singapore' planning areas and their various characteristics.

```{r}
planning_areas <- read_csv(here::here("data/planning_areas.csv"))
glimpse(planning_areas)
```

Most of the variables are relatively self-descriptive. You should know that all variables are relative (i.e. % relative to total population) except two variables: ```hotel_rooms``` and ```schools_secondary``` are both expressed in units per sq km. This isn't so important now but it will come back soon so do take note.

We will get started by applying MDS to only two variables in our dataset: the % of households with income greater than $17.5k; and % of area used by non-HDB residences. Both relate very much to economic class.

You already know how to create a custom 'economic class' space and position with each planning area within that space. this is what a scatterplot does!

```{r}
ggplot(planning_areas, aes(area_res, hh_income_gt_17500)) + 
  geom_text(aes(label = planning_area))
```

It is clear there is a relationship between the two variables but you can also clearly see some specific 'areas' within the chart (e.g. Tanglin + Bukit Timah; Novena + Bishan + Marine Parade + Bedok; Serangoon). Let's see if we can reproduce this plot through MDS as well.

To do so, we need to calculate distances betweeen each point and all other points. As distance calculations in R generally operate on matrices(AFAIK there are no ```tidyverse``` compatible libraries yet), we convert to a matrix first, as we have done in the first two sections. 

### STEP 1
Selecting two variables and casting it into a matrix
```{r}
pln_area_matrix <- planning_areas %>% 
  select(area_res, hh_income_gt_17500) %>% 
  as.matrix()


pln_area_matrix %>% head()
```

Once we have a matrix, we can calculate distance with the ```distances``` function from the library by the same name. It calculated the Euclidean distance between each set of points (like in Pythagoras' Theorem).

```{r}
# Calculate Euclidean dist
library(distances)

pln_area_dist <- distances(pln_area_matrix) %>% 
  as.matrix()

pln_area_dist %>% head()
```

We can now use these distances in the same way as we used the distances between MRT stations. 

```{r}
mds_planning_area <- cmdscale(pln_area_dist) %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  rename(Y1 = V1, Y2 = V2)

mds_planning_area <- planning_areas %>% 
  select(planning_area) %>% 
  bind_cols(., mds_planning_area)

mds_planning_area %>% 
  head()
```

```{r fig.height = 6, fig.width=8}
library(patchwork)
ggplot(mds_planning_area, aes(x = Y2, y = -Y1)) + 
  geom_text(aes(label = planning_area)) +
ggplot(planning_areas, aes(area_res, hh_income_gt_17500)) + 
  geom_text(aes(label = planning_area))
```

### 6.4.1 Exercise

Is the resulting scatterplot a faithful reproduction of the original? 
- not really. Some areas are jumbled up e.g. novena and bishan.

What could be the potential reasons?
- relative vs absolute distances (calculated here). 

```{r}
# Plotting of actual distance 

pln_dist_pred <- cmdscale(pln_area_dist) %>% # rmb to use pln_area_dist as there was a conversion step to dist
  dist(upper=T) %>% 
  as.matrix()

pln_dist <- pln_area_dist

tibble(
  pln_dist = as.vector(pln_dist), 
  pln_dist_pred = as.vector(pln_dist_pred)
) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = pln_dist, y = pln_dist_pred)) + 
  geom_point()
```

```{r}
mds_stress(pln_dist, pln_dist_pred)
```
Stress close to 0. Weird?

## 6.5 MDS of arbitrary variables (more than 2D)

In the exact same way, we add additional variables to our MDS analysis. All it takes is adding these variables to our original matrix.

For example, to add 3 additional variables related to economic class, you could do:

```{r}
pln_area_matrix <- planning_areas %>% 
  select(area_res, hh_income_gt_17500, edu_university, occupation_senior_manager_professional, status_unemployed) %>% 
  as.matrix()
```


Or include all variables except ```planning_area```:

```{r}
pln_area_matrix <- planning_areas %>% 
  select(-planning_area) %>% 
  as.matrix()
```

```distances``` will calculate the Euclidean distances across as many dimensions as you'd like. For n-dimentional space, (x,y,..., n).

```{r}
pln_area_dist <- distances(pln_area_matrix) %>% 
  as.matrix()

mds_planning_area <- cmdscale(pln_area_dist) %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  rename(Y1 = V1, Y2 = V2)

# add planning area name back

mds_planning_area <- planning_areas %>% 
  select(planning_area) %>% 
  bind_cols(., mds_planning_area)

ggplot(mds_planning_area, aes(x = Y1, y = Y2)) + 
  geom_text(aes(label = planning_area))
```

One final issue to contend with is that not all our variables are on the same scale. 

While most are in relative percentages, the ```hotel_room``` variable is measured in the number of rooms per sq km. In Outram, there are over 3000 rooms per sq km! This dramatically affects our distances (and distances are often an input for a variety of machine learning techniques), it is generally good practice to normalise all the variables first.

This gets rid of another issue: variables with lower variance will have less impact on the distance as well. 

There are quite a few ways to normalize a variable. Here we use a built-in feature of ```distances``` that normalizes by the variance (also called studentizing).

```{r fig.height=8, fig.width=10}
pln_area_dist <- distances(pln_area_matrix, normalize = "studentize") %>% 
  as.matrix()

mds_planning_area <- cmdscale(pln_area_dist) %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  rename(Y1 = V1, Y2 = V2)

# add planning area name back
mds_planning_area <- planning_areas %>% 
  select(planning_area) %>% 
  bind_cols(., mds_planning_area)

ggplot(mds_planning_area, aes(x=Y1, y=Y2)) + 
  geom_text(aes(label=planning_area))
```

```{r}
pln_dist_pred_final <- cmdscale(pln_area_dist) %>% 
  dist(upper = T) %>% 
  as.matrix()

  pln_dist_final <- pln_area_dist

tibble(
  pln_dist_final = as.vector(pln_dist_final),
  pln_dist_pred_final = as.vector(pln_dist_pred_final)
) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = pln_dist_final, y = pln_dist_pred_final)) + 
  geom_point()
```

```{r}
mds_stress(pln_dist_final, pln_dist_pred_final)
```
Stress increased as we increased the number of variables. 

A few more questions to consider:

- Based on your own knowledge of Singapore - does the map of Singapore in ‘socio-economic’ space make sense? 
Quite.
- Can you think of more descriptive labels for the x- and y-axes?
x = number of residents/households, y = relative income levels?

The last question is a difficult one! Multidimensional scaling projects an n-dimensional dataset to 2 (or any other number) of dimensions. This can be very useful as it allows you to see similar observations grouped together in space. However, it does not necessarily give ‘meaning’ to the remaining two dimensions. It also does not tell you if perhaps a 3-dimensional representation would capture a much larger portion of the variance (thus decreasing stress) than a 2-dimensional map. To deal with this problem, we have another set of techniques available that we often refer to as principal component analysis, which we will continue with in the next Chapter.

N.B. If you are interested in additional techniques focused on reducing a large number of dimensions to two dimensions for easy visualization and potentially spotting ‘clusters’, you can check out two more recent algorithms that are potentially better able to preserve the ‘structure’ of a multi-dimensional dataset: t-sne and UMAP. You can find an easy to use implementation in the ```smallvi```s and ```uwot``` packages.

## Bonus section

```{r fig.height=8, fig.width=10}
library(uwot)

mds_planning_area <- umap(planning_areas, n_neighbors = 8, scale = TRUE, init = "random") %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  rename(Y1 = V1, Y2 = V2)

mds_planning_area <- planning_areas %>% 
  select(planning_area) %>% 
  bind_cols(., mds_planning_area)

ggplot(mds_planning_area, aes(x = Y1, y = Y2)) + 
  geom_text(aes(label = planning_area))
```
